# Flutter Comments App

A commenting system built with **Flutter** (frontend) and **FastAPI** (backend) with **SQLite** as the database.  
Users can select text in a paragraph, click a floating “Add Comment” button, and see the comment highlighted inline. 
Comments will be stored in the database and are listed below the paragraph.

---

## Features

- Click-and-drag to select text in a paragraph.
- Floating **“Add Comment”** button appears near the selected text.
- Highlights selected text with comments in yellow.
- Stores comments with `start_index`, `end_index`, `selected_text`, and `user_name`.
- Backend API with FastAPI:
  - `POST /comments` → Add a comment
  - `GET /comments?paragraph_id=1` → Fetch all comments for a paragraph
- Supports multiple comments per paragraph.
- Fully responsive frontend using Flutter Web or Desktop.
